# Credit Risk Assessment using Machine Learning

Objective of this project was to understand what defines good and bad credit scores. To study this topic, we obtained a dataset from OpenML - “Credit-g” created by  Dr. Hans Hofman. Within the data set, we found that there are multiple features (twenty-one features to be exact) that define good and bad credit risk. We wanted to understand what characteristics have the most impact on one's credit score.
